Reflection matrix approach to computing the seismic response of a cylindrically symmetric medium.

This program was written by George Randall and is based on Kennett's (1983).

1_src: only pick up the useful files.
       no other dependences
2_src: put the subs in src
       can put together/ no need the link file
3_src: add interface.f for python test
       By f2py.
