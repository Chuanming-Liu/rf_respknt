1. Because of the limit of array length, take care to change the dt and tduring.
2. problem:
1) the amplitude of respknt is not consistent with Vs of first layer.
   need to be normalized.
2) the amplitude of theo is not consistent with Vs of first layer
   setting problem.
3) waveform of theo just a pulse.
   setting problem.
